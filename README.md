# The-power-of-words
How our selection of words impacts other people's emotion and unconsciousness? (Machine learning in computational social science)

When we read a text or web page, we receive a particular feeling or provocation of a thought that is caused by the text's opinion and emotion. Using the text mining method, we can derive so-called **sentiments** of the text.

Here I use The gutenbergr package to illustrate the positive and negative sentiments of **The Brothers Karamazov**, the last novel by Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. As you can see from the graphs below, "**afraid**" and "**like**" were the most frequent negative and positive words used by Dostoevsky.Â
